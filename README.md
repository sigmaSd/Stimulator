## Features

- Overrides system setting and disables automatic suspending
- Overrides system setting and disables screen blanking and screen locking
- Option to use system default, light or dark theme
- AppIndicator support

## How it works

Uses `Gtk.Application.inhibit (Suspend)` which internally uses
`org.freedesktop.portal.Inhibit` which should work across DEs that supports it.

For disabling screen blanking/locking, it uses
`org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver.Inhibit` and fallsback to
`Gtk.Application.inhibit (Idle)` if its not supported.
